  funFacts:
  - Venus spins backward on its axis compared to most planets, making the Sun rise
    in the west and set in the east.
  - Its thick atmosphere traps heat, making it the hottest planet in our solar system.
  - The surface is dominated by volcanic landscapes and has more volcanoes than any
    other planet.
  - Venus' surface pressure is 90 times that of Earth, equivalent to being a mile
    underwater.
  - Venus is the brightest planet in our sky, visible even during the day.
