  funFacts:
  - Uranus rotates on its side, likely due to a collision early in its history.
  - "It's classified as an \u201Cice giant\u201D due to its cold, icy atmosphere
    containing water, ammonia, and methane."
  - Uranus has 13 known rings, fainter than Saturn's.
  - Its unique tilt causes extreme seasons, lasting over 20 years each.
  - Methane in the atmosphere gives Uranus its blue-green hue.
