  funFacts:
  - Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun but isn't the hottest, thanks to its
    lack of atmosphere.
  - Its surface is heavily cratered, resembling our Moon.
  - A year on Mercury (one orbit around the Sun) takes only 88 Earth days.
  - Mercury experiences the most significant temperature fluctuations, from blistering
    hot to freezing cold.
  - It's the smallest planet in our solar system.
